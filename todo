COLORS:
[ ] add a contrast color checker
[ ] add a way to choose/select colors in color through changing the hex code directly (maybe using a different color picker tool)
[ ] having a semantic value for each color

EXTRA:
[ ] design commonly used widgets - make sure they are using rem and responsive design
    [ ] buttons
    [ ] forms
    [ ] login page
[ ] different types of branding color schemes
[ ] if any, which colors in the palette are okay to be the same?
[ ] color theory when it comes to branding
